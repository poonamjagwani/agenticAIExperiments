```json
{
    "todos": [
        {
            "id": "unique-id",
            "text": "Todo item text",
            "completed": false,
            "createdAt": "2024-03-06T15:00:00.000Z"
        }
    ]
}
```

## UI Design
- Clean, minimalist interface
- Responsive design (mobile-first)
- Visual feedback for actions
- Clear status indicators for todo items

## Error Handling
1. Empty todo items not allowed
2. Duplicate todos allowed
3. Graceful handling of localStorage errors
4. Max length for todo text (200 characters)

## Performance Considerations
1. Efficient DOM updates
2. Minimal re-renders
3. Debounced save operations
4. Optimized localStorage interactions
